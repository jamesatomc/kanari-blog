## Understanding k1, k2, and moveOS 

The Kanari SDK utilizes a node-based architecture to manage its operations efficiently. Three critical nodes in this architecture are the **k1**, **k2**, and **moveOS** nodes.

### k1 Node

The **k1** node is responsible for initializing the core components of the SDK. It handles the setup of essential services and ensures that all dependencies are correctly configured before any operations begin. The k1 node acts as the entry point for the SDK, orchestrating the initial workflow and preparing the environment for subsequent processes.

### k2 Node

The **k2** node, on the other hand, manages the execution of specific tasks within the SDK. It takes over from the k1 node once the initial setup is complete and coordinates the execution of various modules and functions. The k2 node ensures that tasks are performed in the correct sequence and handles any inter-module communication required during the process.

### moveOS Node

The **moveOS** node is designed to optimize the movement and orchestration of data within the SDK. It ensures that data flows smoothly between different nodes and modules, enhancing the overall efficiency and performance of the system. The moveOS node also handles error detection and recovery, ensuring robust and reliable operations.

Together, the k1, k2, and moveOS nodes form the backbone of the Kanari SDK's architecture, enabling a streamlined and efficient workflow from initialization to execution.
